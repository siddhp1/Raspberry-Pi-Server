# Raspberry Pi Server 

Customizable Python script to add a power/sleep button, LED status indicators, and an LCD information display to a Raspberry Pi server. 

The sleep functionality is currently incomplete and will be finished soon. 

This program is recommended to be installed as a Linux service so it can be run on startup.

Required components, schematics and instructions will be added soon.
